1.
Definition of Edge Computing:
Edge computing refers to a distributed computing paradigm where data processing occurs closer to the data source, such as on IoT devices or local servers, rather than relying solely on centralized cloud servers.

How AI Enhances Edge Computing:
AI enhances edge computing by enabling intelligent data processing at the edge of the network. This reduces latency, improves efficiency, and allows real-time decision-making without needing to transmit large volumes of data to distant servers.

Example:
In autonomous vehicles, AI-powered edge computing helps in obstacle detection and navigation by processing sensor data locally, ensuring quicker responses and enhancing safety.


2.
AI and IoT Integration:

Improvement in Smart Home Systems:
The integration of AI with IoT enhances smart home systems by making devices more adaptive, autonomous, and efficient. AI algorithms can analyze data from IoT sensors to optimize energy usage, detect unusual patterns, and provide personalized automation.

Example:
A smart thermostat like Google Nest uses AI to learn user preferences and automatically adjust the temperature, improving energy efficiency and comfort.


3.
AI and IoB (Internet of Bodies):

Definition of IoB:
The Internet of Bodies (IoB) refers to the network of connected devices that are either implanted, ingested, or worn on the body to monitor health metrics.

AI Integration in IoB for Healthcare Monitoring:
AI improves IoB by analyzing health data in real time, detecting anomalies, and predicting potential health issues. This enables early intervention and personalized healthcare.

Example:
Smart insulin pumps use AI to monitor glucose levels and automatically administer the correct insulin dosage, helping diabetic patients manage their condition more effectively.


4.
Human-AI Collaboration:

Definition of Human-AI Collaboration:
Human-AI collaboration refers to the partnership between humans and AI systems where AI assists in decision-making, automation, or creative processes, enhancing human capabilities.

Benefits in Industries:

Healthcare: AI helps doctors analyze medical images faster and more accurately, aiding in early diagnosis.

Creative Arts: AI tools like Adobe Sensei assist graphic designers by generating design suggestions and automating repetitive tasks.

Example:
In music production, AI tools like Amper Music help musicians compose background tracks, enabling faster music creation with personalized styles.
